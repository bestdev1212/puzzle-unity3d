# [![Nodulus Logo](docs/Logo/nodulus-logo-28.png)](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/nodulus) Nodulus

Nodulus is a puzzle game with a clever twist. Based on the mathematical theory behind plank puzzles, the game consists of a grid of cubes and rods which can be rotated with a swipe. Turn the activated cubes to reach the end cube to win the level.
